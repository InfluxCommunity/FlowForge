# FlowForge

FlowForge is a powerful, flexible, and user-friendly tool for building complex flows and pipelines. Utilizing NodeRed technology, FlowForge provides a visual programming model that simplifies the process of integrating and transforming data across various sources.

This repository contains a collection of FlowForge / NodeRed examples that demonstrate how to interact with InfluxDB 3.0. Each example showcases a unique use case, allowing users to learn from real-world scenarios and apply these principles to their own projects.
